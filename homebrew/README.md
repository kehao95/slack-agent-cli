# Homebrew Formula

This directory contains the Homebrew formula for slack-agent-cli, automatically generated and updated by GoReleaser during the release process.

## Installation

```bash
brew install kehao95/slack-agent-cli/slack-agent-cli
```

## How it Works

When a new release tag is pushed, GoReleaser:
1. Builds binaries for all platforms
2. Generates `slack-agent-cli.rb` formula in this directory
3. Commits the formula back to this repository
4. Users can install directly from this repo (no separate tap needed)
